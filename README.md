Hello,

in this repository you will find the main code for my website [rink.gallery](https://www.rink.gallery/). The site was written in typescript react about one and a half years ago, but I tinkered with the idea and prototypes since the beginning of my studies. The code is here mainly as a initial portfolio.

### What is on the website?
The main page is a gallery of images I took, which are currently hosted by the CMS contentful. The second type of content consits of markdown files, which are hosted on the server and accessed via a GraphQL API. The API is probably not necessary, but it's more fun that way.

Thanks for visiting, have a nice day! 👋🙂
